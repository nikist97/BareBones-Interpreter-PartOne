A very simple interpreter for Bare Bones.
You can edit the Bare Bones code in the source.txt file 
Assumptions: 
a variable must be initiated before being used with incr, decr, or with the while loop 
variables names must contain only a-z or A-Z characters 
while loop allows any numbers (not only 0) 
each instruction is on a separate line, blank lines are allowed 
indentation matters, each statement must start on the beginning of the line; when there's a while loop it should be indented with 3 spaces 
the semicolon at the end of each line must be separated from the previous token - "incr x ;" not "incr x;"
